First succesful read from the RP2040 Zero!

Rewiring so the sensor actually connects to a ADC pin.

fount issue after looking through the readings, the response rate is sooooo high that Putty is lagging behind.
- Add delay in the code to be able to read the response from the RP2040 Zero.

Add LED so press can be indicated.

Started prototyping for the multichannel switcher module.
And actually finished it!

not working after adding the multiplexer, debugging...

it looks like the sot-23 version of the hall effect sensor requires a higher working voltage.
fuck I thought it was the same and connected the multipler (which works at 5V) with the hall effect sensor (which works at 8V) in series.

probed the multiplexer with a sin wave as a input, verified that it is working.
now it seems that the issue is with the hall effect sensor.

FUCKKKKKKK.
Guess that's my fault.
I soldered the wrong ground pin on the hall effect sensor. PLUS, it doesn't need 8V, 5 should be enough.
The pinout for the sensor has two verion, one with SOT-23 and another one is SIP.

Now I gotta desolder the whole shit and redo it. FINE.

Rewired, everthing is working as expected.

However, the readings are off, the response is slow? or i could even say it's just random values.

Did some more testing, found out that is because I'm constantly calling changes to adc_select_input() function, which is causing the some lagging, could be solves using the round robin approach, i bet.
The working code is out.

But I didn't test the round robin approach yet, the last photo was a using a single ADC pin with multiplexer doing its job.

I'll test the round robin approach and update the code.

That's the end for today...
