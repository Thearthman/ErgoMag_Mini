Todays job is to get multiple adc readings at the same time.
I've been looking through a university lecture which I believe will get me the stuff I need.

It seems that round robin mode is what I'm looking for, but I'm not sure how to use it.
It seems like I have been using software interrupt to read the adc values. 
I need a DMA and use FIFO for the ADC.

This website seems to be helpful, it contains a fully functional code for reading multiple adc values using DMA and FIFO.
