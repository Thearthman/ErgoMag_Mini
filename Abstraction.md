# PCB Design  
## Keybaord Layout  
1. Find the optimal ergonomic layout for the keyboard.  
2. Design the PCB layout using a PCB design software.  
## Schematic Design  
1. Would require [Circuitry Design](#circuitry-design) to be done first.  
2. Design the schematic using a circuit design software.  


# Circuitry Design  
1. Test run the Circuitry on a RP2040 board to and find latency and noise issues.  
2. Decide the chip to use.   
3. Go to the [Schematic Design](#schematic-design) step.  


# 3D Modeling  
1. Done after [PCB Design](#pcb-design), relaying on [Keyboard Layout](#keybaord-layout)
